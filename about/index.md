I'm a fourth year undergraduate CS student currently studying at UCLA. As I dive into really awesome areas like Machine Learning or Computer Vision, I want to provide clear and concise explanations to help anyone curious about the topics. These posts will not only allow me to further understand each topic but could also provide you with some new insight as well.
