Detailed explanations for all computer vision and machine learning. After taking an introductory computer vision course I found that there was a general lack of resources clearly explaining many computer vision concepts thorough enough. My goal is so that once you see one post you will be completely fluent in the topic and will not have to look at any more resources as I had to. 

## People I'd like to thank

* Professor Stefano Soatto in CS174B for a great introductory course
* Sriram Sankararaman for CS 188 Machine Learning, another great introductory course

## About Me

I'm a UCLA computer science undergrad. A well-known Richard Feynman technique is that in order to learn something well, teach it and find your gaps. While my ultimate goal is to help others, I would appreciate anyone who would contact me with any tips or corrections. It would definitely make my day ^^.
