I’m a 4rth year undergrad at UCLA. Currently doing research at the Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy Group and Ozcan Research Group under Yair Rivenson. I found a general lack of good explanations online for Computer Vision material so I thought I would contribute some of my own thought to it.

## What this blog is about:

* Detailed explanations for topics in Computer Vision and Machine Learning
* My goal is so that the explanations are so well-defined you won’t have to do as much google searching as I did in order to understand the computer vision material
* I will include explanations for every calculations and derivations even the pre-req’s such as linear algebra and calculus. 
* Please feel free to contact me with ANY suggestions. If you think I missed something or you think another link is relevant then please please comment or email me.

## Thanks
* I’d like to thank professor Sriram Sankararaman for teaching CS188 Machine Learning and professor Stefano Soatto for teaching CS174B Image-Based Modeling.
