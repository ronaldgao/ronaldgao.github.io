## Pre-requisites:

* At least some basic calculus understanding. I won't be going over something like partial derivative but if there is a derivation that involves something a bit more tedious like a Jacobian I will still explain it
* Basic high school math skills
* Definitely need to know how to code. For this course I will be using OpenCV with Python and C++ (i'll try to provide both versions of the same code). For any Machine learning I will be using Python. 
* Preferred: Some linear algebra skills and matrix understanding
* I will cover literally anything nontrivial so don't worry

## Textbooks ( You won't need any because the purpose of this blog is to inform u so much that u don't have to get a textbook):
There are honestly way too many. You can google this and there are very many good ones. They might have different notation so beware. 

* An Invitation to 3-D Vision: From Images to Geometric models. 
* Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications by Richard S
* Computer Vision: A Modern Approach (I think you can buy a solution set for this one)
* Multi-view geometry in computer Vision
* basically any computer vision book on amazon. 

## I will try to blog as if I am teaching a course so everything you learn here can be used in an inroductory computer vision course
