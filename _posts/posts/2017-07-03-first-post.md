## Prerequisites:

* At least some basic calculus understanding. I won't be going over something like partial derivative but if there is a derivation that involves something a bit more tedious like a Jacobian I will still explain it
* Basic high school math skills
* Definitely need to know how to code. For this course I will be using OpenCV with Python and C++ (i'll try to provide both versions of the same code). For any Machine learning I will be using Python.
* Preferred: Some linear algebra skills and matrix understanding
* I will cover literally anything nontrivial so don't worry

## Textbooks:
There are honestly way too many. They might _have_ different notation so beware.

Computer Vision:

* An Invitation to 3-D Vision: From Images to Geometric models (Ma, Koˇseck´a, Soatto, Sastry)
* Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Richard S)
* Computer Vision: A Modern Approach (Forsyth, Ponce)
* Multi-view Geometry in Computer Vision (Hartley, Zisserman)

Optimization:
* An Introduction to Optimization (Chong, Zak)
